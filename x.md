The Synology NAS (Network Attached Storage) platform primarily supports the following languages for development and configuration:

Bash/Shell Scripting: For automating tasks, managing scripts, and interacting with the Synology DSM (DiskStation Manager) OS via SSH.

Python: Commonly used for creating custom packages, automations, and scripts on the NAS.

JavaScript: Often used in web applications or packages that run on DSM, especially those with a web-based user interface.

PHP: Some packages or custom web applications for DSM may be written in PHP.

Java: Can be used for more complex applications that need to run on a Java runtime environment on the NAS.

Synology APIs: The Synology NAS supports a range of RESTful APIs, which can be accessed from applications written in almost any language that can make HTTP requests (e.g., Python, JavaScript, or PHP).

The Synology DSM itself is built on a Linux-based operating system, so anything that runs on Linux can theoretically be adapted for use on Synology devices with the right configuration.
